# ðŸ§¬ HDC-Net: Hybrid Dilated Convolution Network for 3D Medical Image Segmentation

This repository contains an implementation of **HDC-Net**, a deep learning architecture designed for accurate segmentation of 3D medical volumes, such as CT or MRI scans. It is especially effective for **liver tumor segmentation**, but the framework is adaptable to other 3D biomedical imaging tasks.

## ðŸ§  What is HDC-Net?

HDC-Net (Hybrid Dilated Convolutional Network) combines:

- **U-Net structure** for encoder-decoder learning  
- **Hybrid Dilated Convolutions** for better multi-scale feature extraction  
- **Residual and skip connections** to maintain spatial precision
